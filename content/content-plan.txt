Support Plan:

Why?
We need to provide support to our customers, they will be lost and will need help.

Start with some minimal documentation and Yosem's phone number
As we grow use a different phone number

Why to build documentation?
 - Help new users understand how the system works
 - provide real use cases for the company to develop content collaboratively through loorp
