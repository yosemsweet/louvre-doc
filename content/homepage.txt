Key points:
*What is it?*
Loorp is a collaborative publishing platform that helps you collect, organize, and make accessible your community's ideas.


We use 3 core components to help you save time.
1) Community - The engine at the heart of Loorp is our collaborative tool set allowing you to work with your friends, colleagues and peers to make a difference. 

  
2) Feed - Loorp adds new information for discussion by the community through the Feed system. The Feed system provides easy and fast methods to present new ideas and information to the community. You can quickly add information from other websites, social networks, forums, or even email chains. Your community can also add new ideas directly to the feed from Loorp itself.


3) Publishing - With Loorp it is easy to combine the best of the input from the feed into permanent pages. Loorp uses a simple drag and drop page creation and editing system so you don't have to waste your time building pages.
