New ideas are constantly being submitted by your members. Once an idea is in Loorp your community can discuss, shape, and promote it. Ideas can be used to generate pages or even better ideas.  
  
3) Feed - Loorp adds new information for discussion by the community through the Feed system. The Feed system provides easy and fast methods to present new ideas and information to the community.
