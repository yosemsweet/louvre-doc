Scenario - Gill Fert starting a Canvas:

Gill just received an email from a friend suggesting she check out www.asaucybook.com. The email said A Saucy Book is a great place for Gill and her friends to create the new canonical guide to dressing as a women over 40. Intrigued by the domain name Gill decides to check the site out once she gets home from work between updating her blog and connecting with her friends on Facebook.

When Gill visits A Saucy Book she sees how A Saucy Book can help her and her friends collaborate to make something great. Intrigued but still a little uncertain about how A Saucy Book can make a difference for Gill she decides to check out the featured community, the Vancouver New Parents Community. As she browses around she sees that the Vancouver New Parents Community is using A Saucy Book to create a step by step guide for the best and worst of being a new parent in Vancouver, BC. She also sees that community is very active, with information constantly updating and several people talking about a new child care provider they are looking at. Gill even notices that some of her facebook friends are participants in other communities at A Saucy Book.

Her concerns abated Gill hits the link to "Get Your Community Started" and is immediately asked for some key details about her community (name = "A Certain Age Fashion", mission, etc). She also agrees to let A Saucy Book log her in with Facebook. All of a sudden Gill has her own Canvas on A Saucy Book. Initially this canvas which walks Gill through the process of editing the canvas pages, using the input stream, and inviting other community members. By the time Gill is done she's got her first mission statement clarified and her first 2 pages created along with a couple pieces of input the input stream.
