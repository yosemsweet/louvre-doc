Scenario - Chad Hansen visiting Louvre:

Chad visits Louvre every evening and checks to see what new ideas and information has come in. Chad has a particular attachment to a couple Canvæ; How to Maintain and Love Your Portuguese Car and Best Shallow Water Scuba Dives, so he first focuses on any new pieces of information that have come in, commenting on each piece. Next he reviews all changes to his favorite Canvæ and if he sees any he disagrees with he reverts the pages to how they were while sending an brief note to whomever made the change.

Once Chad has completed his review of his two favorite Canvæ he'll start to through all the latest changes to pages on Louvre, checking each one for accuracy, wherever he sees something wrong or even just poorly worded he'll make a change to the page and send a note to the member who made the change.

For the most part Chad hasn't built up many relationships on Louvre but there are 5 people who have really appreciated his hard work and engaged him for discussion and chat, so at the end every visit to Louvre he checks to see if any of them are online and chats with any who are, often about some the changes he's made and where he thinks things are headed, but sometimes just about life or economics.
