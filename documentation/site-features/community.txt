*Community*

Loorp allows individuals to create communities. These communities are intended to be topically themed places where the community creator can work together with people interested in the same topic. While a community can be just a place to share and discuss interesting ideas Loorp really comes into its own when your community wants to draw out and make more accessible the knowledge locked within it.

Communities have several specific features:

* Community settings

** Types of Communities
All communities require to be a member of the community to contribute or modify the community's information. 

*** Open Communities
An open community is one where anyone can join. This results in a very open and freeflowing experience within the community. Any community who's focus and need for expertise extends beyond the bounds of the creators circle of influence is a great candidate for an open community. For example a community focused on analyzing fiscal policy in the EU would benefit greatly from a breadth of viewpoints which is easier to gain with an open community.

*** Closed Communities
A closed community requires non-members to apply for permission to join the community. The owner of the community can approve, decline, or ban an applicant based on their application request as well as any background information they wish to gather. Closed communities make sense when the topic being discussed needs a certain amount of moderation (say a community focused on planning a wedding or corporate documentation and support community) or when there is a high likelihood of trolls (political or religious communities being prime examples).

*** Public Communities
A public community is visible to anyone and everyone. The communities pages and feed are public, although only editable by community members.

*** Private Communities (coming soon)
A private community is only visible to members. If someone who isn't a member even tries to view a page they will be asked to apply instead.

* Snippets
At Loorp, communities work together on and with snippets. A snippet is a small self contained piece of information that can be discussed, evolved, and used. Any member of a community can make, edit, or discuss a snippet. Snippets can be categorized, evolved, and ultimately used when packaging community knowledge.

* Feed
Every community has a feed where members can post/share anything they want and engage in community centered interactions. Information added to the feed can only be edited/deleted by admins, community owners, and the person who created the information. From the feed community members can promote any item within the feed (individual post, reply, or even a whole discussion) to a snippet if they feel it has information worth saving.

* Pages
Every community has a collection of pages. Pages are built by the community from snippets and allow the community to tie together related snippets into cohesive and accessible collections of information. Pages represent the simplest form of packaging information for improved accessibility.
