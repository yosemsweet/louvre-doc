*Snippets*
At Loorp, communities work together on and with snippets. A snippet is a small self contained piece of information that can be discussed, evolved, and used. Any member of a community can add, edit, or start a conversation around, a snippet. Snippets can be categorized, promoted, rejected, and ultimately used when packaging community knowledge.
