Problem we are solving:

This is an informal interview, I'm really here to understand your problems within the context of creating information online, I'm not here to sell or pitch a product to you. I'm just here to learn.

Before we get started and just to set the context let me describe roughly the problem we are working on - 

We've believe there's too little information on the web that's at the same time useful, interesting, appropriately executed (e.g. referential, does its subject justice, well produced within the context of a subject), lasting, extensible and living.
We also believe that many communities, both formal and informal, have tremendous amounts of information locked within them

We're interested in making tools to help communities unlock their knowledge and make it accessible, engaging, and constantly letting it evolve.

Before I get too deep into explaining anything, I'd like to get your take on if any of the problems we are looking to solve resonate with your experiences.

Problem 1:
It is really hard to create and evolve great content by yourself.

Story to explain - 
Keeping old blog posts up to date as information changes.




Problem 2:
It is hard to get communities to contribute great ideas and information





Problem 3:
It is hard to curate and shape the amount of information on the internet





Problem 4:
It is hard to build an authoritative presence on the internet. And even when you succeed it can be hard to to engage and audience.




Beyond that I'd just like to get a feel for how you currently solve any of these problems.



































Thanks! Would you be willing to participate further as we get closer to a solution we can show you?
