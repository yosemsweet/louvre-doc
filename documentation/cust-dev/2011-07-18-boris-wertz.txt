*A Saucy Book Customer Development*

*Boris Wertz Interview Notes - 7/18:*

Boris is looking at the startup universe - he's found that there isn't much that helps summarize information from different people.

He'd really like to build a Startup Bible and crowdsource a lot of the content.

*What tools looked at to accomplish this?*
Systems he's found out there aren't very interactive. 

For instance Quora often times the right answer is a summary or aggregation of all the answers but this is pretty tough to do.
Wiki -> not very engaging experience with output. You end up with a tight and elitest set of contributors.

Really feels that the startup bible needs to be engaging and open to be successful.

In the past also tried matching domain knowledge with writing from an intern. Found that this process (ghost writing knowledge|bringing together knowers + writers|etc) created content that just wasn't deep enough. [Why?]


What is in it for Boris? Why is he interested personally?
Passion for the subject
Also sees it as a chance to build reputation.
Later talked a lot about distribution of the startup bible - seems to feel the startup bible itself would be a valuable product for him to have and share (blog, twitter, etc).  Help establish authority and knowledge in interactions.

*Do the following problems resonate?*
It is really hard to create and evolve great content by yourself.
A: Yes [not a strong reaction initially - later was stronger]. Producing content is really hard. Finds that either having a support group (weightwatchers or personal trainer style) can help, also feels there can be success with a competitive environment although he personally is more motivated by the supporting side.

[We discussed sports as a metaphor for internal support, external competition. Something he felt would help a great deal in terms of driving interactions and making the process of creating content fun - or at least not as much of a grind]

It is hard to get communities to contribute great ideas and information (and when they do the best information doesn't always rise to the top).
A: Yes, rephrased to how to get knowledge out of people's heads. Finds a lot of communities end up elite and not welcoming [ossification].
Really hard to condense the information generated by a community.

It is hard to curate and shape the amount of information on the internet.
A: Yes [ended up focusing more narrowly than internet - even just for a single community this holds true]. How to structure the information can be tough.

It is hard to build an authoritative presence on the internet. And when you succeed it is hard to engage an audience.
A: Sure [didn't seem to resonate so well. true-ish]


*Additional Notes*

*Where would you look for help and contributions to the startup bible?
A: Initially start with his own existing network - 5 to 10 people to get started.
Believes the initial creator will need to do some work to get canvas started.
Once started would start to share via twitter and emails

*[Nearly unbidden - veered from contributions and help discussion - started discussing distribution of Startup Bible]
A: "I'm looking to distribute the startup bible. Brand it W Media Ventures, integrate it with my blog [...]. Distribution is key"

*How hard is distribution of information for you right now?*
A: Accomplishes it already, but providing support would be ideal - especially support with creating facebook and twitter [things] to help with distribution.
Thinks Plancast has done an awesome job of integration with social networks

*What do you use right now for social interactions*
Primarily uses twitter as opposed to FB. Mainly because he uses it professionally. Currently does most of his sharing with email and twitter.

*What would you need to visit every day?*
That's all about the quality of interaction. If the interactions are great, I'm always learning, and there is a wide breadth of input I'll visit every day.

*How much control would you want over the community and the generated content*
Guesses someone will need to be able to make decisions, but mostly worried about ensuring the community is protected. Beyond that focused more on how to condense information.
